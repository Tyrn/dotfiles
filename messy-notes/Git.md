$ ssh-keygen
```
- Create a new SSH key in GitHub web interface and copy/paste the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` contents

- Say `yes` once asked *Are you sure...* (the question is never repeated):
```
$ git clone git@github.com: ...
Cloning into ...
The authenticity of host '...' can't be established.
...
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
